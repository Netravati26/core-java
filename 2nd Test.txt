1) i) public static void main (String args[])
  public means a access specifier , static means a keyword , void means a return type , main means method name and String means array and it is main method which is essential to run the programme.

iii) JVM ; It is a java vertual machine which is an abstract machine , doesn't physically exist
* It Provides run time environment in which byte code can be exicuted.
*It can also provides runtime environment programmes those are written in other languages later converted into java language. 

JRE ; Java runtime environment  
*Set of software tools which is used to develop software applications.
*Provides .class files.
*Contains JVM some other files in which JVM uses at runtime.  

JDK ; Java Development kit 
*It is a java Development environment which is used to develop software applications.
*It contains JRE and some other development tools..

ii) Class : class is an template which contains behaviour and states.
State represents functionalities and behaviour represents method

Object;It is the  copy of class or instance of class.


2)Constructor; It is a Special type of method which has name same as class.

There are two types
Parameterized  Constructor (It contains parameters)
Default Constructor (It doesn't contains any parameter)


4) main method must be static , There are two types of method.. Static and Instance.

5)Because it loads java classes.  

7)class array{



8)We can't use instance variables inside the static method
because static methods belongs to the class itself while instance variables  to belongs to specific instance of class.
 
9) Polymorphism; An object  beehaving differently at given instance of time.

Compile Polymorphism( we use method overloading)
Runtime Polymorphism(we use method overriding)

parent class = new child class();


public class Engineer{
public void solveProblem(){
System.out.println("problem solved by engineer");
}

public  CivilEngineer extends Engineer{
@override
public vois solveproblem(){
System.out.println("Problem solved by civil engineer")
}

public class EngineerRunner{
public static void main((String  []args){
Engineer engineer=new isEngineer
engineer.solveProblem
}
}
 

10)Inheritance;process of acquiring properrties  of one class to another.
